### About This Project:<br />
We sent an HTTP request to the URL we want in our case to _amazon site_. dt we created, i.e. tree traversal. For this task, we will be using another third-party python library, **Beautiful Soup**. It is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
 <br /><br />
 We also used the liberary time to get a delay between our next request otherwise amazon coould have blocked our server,also we have used user agent in attibute because we just can't import the html file from the amazon (ps they dont want automated bot to access there files). <br /><br />
 All data are extracted in the form of _csv fie_ encodes as _UTF-8_ which could easily viewed in the form of _excel sheet_ and can be used for further data analysis.
 <br /><br />
 Also i have attached _AmazonWebscarppeddata.csv , AmazonWebscarppeddata.xlsx , AmazonWebscarppeddata.pdf_ if you wanna view how the output look like.
 <br /><br />This project provide  _NAME OF THE PRODUCT , PRICE , RATING , NUMBER OR REVIEWS , LINK_ of the product viewd on that particular site , also it give result for all the pages.
